Hello!
My name is Dmitrii (aka Aikava).
I'm a frontend/fullstack developer‚Äîor whatever your project or company needs.

This site showcases some of my passions, including technology, programming languages, learning, and writing.
The main purpose of this blog is to demonstrate my skills (as a portfolio) and share knowledge.

I have been on a long journey in the world of programming for over 8 years, learning from some of the best specialists (in my opinion) while working in great companies and teams.

I hope my experience will be helpful to you.


At the very least, this blog serves as my portfolio. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
