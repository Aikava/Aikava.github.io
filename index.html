      <p>Demonomicon - is programming approach about creating documentation, writing code and time/resource management.
	Is mostly about treating people as some set of resource (skills and ability), and how to manage them.</p>
      <p>In this concept, finished work should have positive result at least in one of group: Joy, Coins or Time.
We spend our time to transform joy into coins,

Or, in general. Try to find a way to use your resources, to get more resources in the same time.</p>
