# About me

Hello, my name is Dmitrii and is my blog/site and place when i share my patience to the world and practicing in everything.

During my developer path as a frontend and full-stack developer, I have rich experience in various aspects of web development, ranging from client-side technologies to server-side and optimization processes. Includes not only the code, but also testing, learning, teaching, documentation and communication.

And i believe personall blog is good place to store or this funny and nice stuff.

Hope you feel nice during wandering through my ideas and some projects.
