# The Feynman Technique
- Define the Problem (Clearly state it)
- Explain it simply (Write it out as if you're teaching a beginner)
- Identify Gaps (Find areas where your understanding falters)
- Refine (Solve gaps and simplify further)

# Polya's Problem-Solving Framework
- Understand the problem (What is known? What needs to be found?)
- Device a plan (Explore different approaches)
- Carry out a plan (Implement the solution and check the errors)
- Review/Extend (Analyze and generalize solution)
