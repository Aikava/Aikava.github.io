Hello!
My name is Aikava, nice to meet you!

Iâ€™m passionate about computers, technology, and the fascinating things that happen when the human mind intersects with innovative tech.

This repository is where I experiment with code and share everything I discover, learn, and explore during my journey as a developer.
