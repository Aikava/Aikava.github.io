# demonomicon.net - blog about unix demonology

## Description
Demonomicon - is programming approach about creating documentation, writing code and time/resource management.
Is mostly about treating people as some set of resource (skills and ability), and how to manage them.

In this concept, finished work should have positive result at least in one of group: Joy, Coins or Time.
We spend our time to transform joy into coins,
and then, we spent time to transform coins into joy.
Or, in general. Try to find a way to use your resources, to get more resources in the same time.

To provide the best and clearest commands and strategy, I (the developer) collaborate with a team of AI subpersonalities, overseen by an AI-Manager, with support from an AI-Designer and AI-Analytics.

The user interface tools are part of a game set in a virtual office, where AI controls the characters, and the player works on projects within this environment. The internal virtual messenger should function as a subpersonal chat, and the planning tools should be presented as a mind map.
